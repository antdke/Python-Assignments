## Assignment 3: Program #2: Guess the Number Game

"""
This program does the following:

1)This program possesses a random secret number between 1 and 10.
2)The user has three tries to guess the secret number.
3)If the user guesses the number within the three tries, then they win.
4)If the user doesn't guess the number within the three tries, then the program disclosed the secret number to the user, and the program ends.
